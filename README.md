# Voipfone Client

A gem to programatically manipulate your [Voipfone](http://www.voipfone.co.uk) account using Ruby.

Voipfone is a brilliant SIP VOIP provider with a very neat set of features, but unfortunately no API. So this gem hopefully fills that gap by using the same JSON API their web interface uses.

## Installation

At the moment this gem isn't published in Rubygems. So you'll need to add it directly from github:

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'voipfone_client', git: "http://github.com/errorstudio/voipfone_client.git"

And then execute:

    $ bundle
