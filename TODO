 - move login functionality into VoipfoneSession base class which all others inherit from
 - mechanize picks up local cookie jar if it exists (and overwrites if it needs to log in)
 - everything subclasses VoipfoneSession (including things like Account which have balance, account_details etc)
 - remove monkey patching - no need for it, if we can subclass everything
